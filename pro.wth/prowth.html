          <h2>PURPOSE OF DOING IT.</h2>
        <h3>
          Treeplant and dryleaves improves agriculture by providing manure or compost,provides funds 
          for individuals especially the people living in the rural areas by making local brooms and 
          suppling wet leaves to gardners or farmers,provides an hygiene system (i.e houses and areas
          with trees and gardens) and encourages deforestation. Production of papers,charcoal,writing material like pencil will be in larger quantity for 
          the available masses and exportation system when dry trees are cut down and recycled instead of 
          getting burnt manually or by lightening.Research has found out that dry trees and palm leaves v get burnt by
          itself due to the occurence of the lightening.

              <h2><b>RECYLING BENEFITS OF DRY TREEPLANT AND LEAVES.</b></h2>
             <h3>Dry trees are benefitial for the purpose of charcoal production in larger quantity,in other for a mining coal firm to stand,
more dry wood(Trees)will be needed for this recyling process to take.Research has it that charcoal is still used as a fueling 
cooking means by millions. Recycling of dry trees could result to sticks/planks for doors,windows,table etc (domestic and 
industial construction).When Dry leaves falls to the ground,picked and pilled up in more quantity by a farmer allow it get by water it will 
lead to compost or manure which will require the crops to grow efficiently.This process has other systems that's benefitial to the country.
